## 4 The Kulla-Conty Microfacet BRDF

Implemented the Kulla-Conty approximation on energy-preserving for the microfacet BRDF.

This figure shows the energy compensation by the KC approximation.

The roughness increases from left to right. The first row is a bit brighter than the second row which does not have compensation.

There is also a White Furnace Test for fun :)

## 5 Denoising in Real-time Ray Tracing

Implemented spatio-temporal filtering techniques widely used in RTRT

- Spatial denoising: joint bilateral filtering with growing kernel size (Ã€-Trous Wavelet)
- Temporal denoising: projection by motion vectors
