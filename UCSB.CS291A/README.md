# Real-time High Quality Rendering

## 1 Real-time Shadows (PCF and PCSS)

Rendered percentage closer soft shadows:

## 2 Precomputed Radiance Transfer

Implemented Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT), which basically pre-computes both lighting and light transport approximated by spherical harmonics, and reproduces global illumination in real-time.

![prt-sh-rotation](hw2/images/PRT_Rotation_cornellbox.gif)

You can notice that the red/green/white walls of the rotating cornell box alternate to illuminate our Mary maid model, with decent inter-reflections between hair, clothes, and body.

## 3 Screen Space Ray Tracing

Obtained two-bounce global illumination by screen space ray tracing (accelerated with Mipmap depth maps)

## 4 The Kulla-Conty Microfacet BRDF

Implemented the Kulla-Conty approximation on energy-preserving for the microfacet BRDF.

This figure shows the energy compensation by the KC approximation.

The roughness decreases from left to right. The first row is a bit brighter than the second row which does not have compensation.

There is also a White Furnace Test for fun :)

## 5 Denoising in Real-time Ray Tracing

Implemented spatio-temporal filtering techniques widely used in RTRT

- Spatial denoising: joint bilateral filtering with growing kernel size (Ã€-Trous Wavelet)
- Temporal denoising: projection by motion vectors
